 Description : Project 4: File Timing

 -	Implement a projegram to measure the impact of application-level buffer
 sizes on file write and read times. This involves writing to and reading
 from a large file (2GB). Vary the application buffer size (from 64 bytes to
 128 bytes to 256 bytes to ... to 64 KB, doubling buffer size each step).
